# rideHailing
Ridesharing services have revolutionized urban transportation, offering convenient and (supposedly) affordable on-demand travel. A key aspect of ride-hailing's appeal is its reliance on technology to ensure fair pricing.  Riders expect upfront pricing based on factors like distance and estimated time, with the final fare metered at the end of the trip. Transparency and predictability in fares are crucial for building trust with riders and maintaining a positive user experience.

Despite these expectations, there are instances where riders believe they have been overcharged.  These overcharges can erode trust and lead to customer churn. To improve fairness and transparency, ride-hailing companies must identify the root causes of overcharged rides and implement solutions to minimize their occurrence.
In this report, I analyze a dataset of ride-hailing trip information to identify patterns and trends associated with overcharged rides.
